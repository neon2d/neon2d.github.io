  "body": "### What is neon?\r\nneon2d is a simple, easy to use 2d game engine for C# that is in active development! The project is completely free to use for any kind of project. You can get up and running with neon very quickly and documentation is being updated as quickly as possible to make learning the latest neon version super easy.\r\n\r\n### Where can I get neon?\r\nneon2d is available as a .ZIP download from the repository's main page: [https://github.com/neon2d/neon2d](https://github.com/neon2d/neon2d). Or you can grab the .zip directly from right [here](https://github.com/neon2d/neon2d/archive/master.zip). Additionally, every commit and pull request in neon2d/neon2d is automatically built on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/matthewd673/neon2d).\r\n\r\n### What do I do now?\r\nBuild neon (or grab the .dll from /neon2d/bin/Debug/) and reference it in your project. You'll probably also want to get System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms ready for use. Now you have your neon development environment all set up! If you want to get involved in the project, our [Waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/neon2d/neon2d) is the place to be: you can stay up to date with every issue a pull request.\r\n\r\n### How can I learn neon?\r\n[The wiki!](https://github.com/neon2d/neon2d/wiki) It has tons of great info on neon2d that is updated regularly. You can actually get started making a game in a mere 7 minutes ([check it out](https://youtu.be/aFORqlETSM8?list=PLiWXYqEn0_isTsy058rx98HIlljgQqjNY)). Now, you can develop quickly and efficiently without worrying about rendering glitches, fixing your Windows, and coming up with formulas for triangles (*shudder*).\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n* [ApplePicker](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/egq13mif5twae0k/AACt4oJ782f2dl4CIHXKiDcla?dl=0) by [@matthewd673](https://github.com/matthewd673)\r\n* [SuperMorph](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&uid=38850) by [@matthewd673](https://github.com/matthewd673)\r\n\r\nDid you create a game with neon?
